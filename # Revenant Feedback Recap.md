# Revenant Feedback Recap

Striken thru text is stuff thats been changed.
## Jetpack:

* Overall cool concept and passive that makes him stand out, Doesnt feel too good sadly.

~~* Upward thrust too weak to go against gravity~~ Fixed by increasing overall thrust
    
~~* Could increase thrust when falling, and hard limiting the negative velocity as soon as space is pressed.~~ Already implemented on custom GenericCharacterMain

~~* Maybe make the max vertical thrust speed capped~~

~~* Fuel shouldnt be spent immediatly as soon as spacebar is pressed, maybe have a moment of leniency so that you can do hops easily.~~

## Rockets:

~~* Should spawn from the center instead of from child, use a flashy effect to hide the fact the spawn isnt centered.~~
~~* Homing rocket should be more controllable (Maybe shot a raycast and if it finds something manually set the target?)~~
 ~~* Create a new ProjectileDirectionalTargetFinder but with homing set to "Angle" instead of Angle+Distance.~~
 ~~* Current homing behaviour shifting feels unreliable and sudden.~~
 ~~* Should probably 1 shot wisps with a single shot at level 1~~

## Lasers:
* Deceptively Weak, Damage falloff makes the attack difficult to use and slightly punishing due to the base slow attack speed. 

## Slash:

* Nigh useless in its current state.
* Hitbox is too small.
* Could be overall reworked so the slash itself is a primary, and the missile/lasers are the secondary

## Dash:

* Should probably be a blink instead of a force impulse (Alt skill?)
* Feels unecesary


## Specials:

* Area Indicator needed
* Look into making the rocket an orb (?)
* Rocket version shouldnt spawn homing rockets, maybe make them a lot faster 
* Feels like 90% of the kit's damage is in this skill.
